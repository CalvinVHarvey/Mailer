# Mailer
Mail plugin


#Introduction

Developed this plugin originally for my Minecraft server Frontier which is a an earthmap geopolitical server.

That being said it will work on any server.

This plugin lets you create mail boxes and send physical mail to other players via the form of a Book and quil

To create a Mail Box all you have to do is put [mailbox] on the first line of a sign and then you are all set



#Commands

As of right now the only command you can use is the /sendmail command which will send the book and quil you are holding to another players inventory

and if that player is offline if they have one it will send it to their mail box.
